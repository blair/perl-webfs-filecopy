Package WebFS::FileCopy version 0.02

This is the WebFS::FileCopy package.  This module provides subroutines
for the getting, putting, copying, moving and deleting of files located
by URLs.  It also supports listing directories identified by URL.
Currently, files for getting can use any URL protocol, such as file,
FTP, HTTP, etc.  For putting, only the file and ftp protocols are
currently supported.

Notable features:

   * Uses LWPng for simultaneous file transfers.

   * Get the contents of multiple URLs simultaneously.

   * Put content into multiple URLs simultaneously.

   * Copy multiple files located by URLs to multiple locations simultaneously.

   * Delete a file located by a URL.

   * Move a file located from located at one URL to another location.

   * List the contents of a URL directory.

WARNING

This package is based on Gisle Aas's LWPng-alpha module, which is still
alpha code.  Because the LWPng interface may change in the future, this
module may break if LWPng is updated in the future without updating
WebFS::FileCopy.

REQUIREMENTS

   * Perl 5.004_04 or greater.

   * LWPng-alpha-0.21 or greater.

   * Net::FTP.
