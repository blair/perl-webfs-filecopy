Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text
files, extracting information from those text files, and
printing reports based on that information.  It's also a
good language for many system management tasks.  The
language is intended to be practical (easy to use,
efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant,
minimal).
