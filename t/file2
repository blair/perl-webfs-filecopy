In this world there are people
who like hornets and gnats.
These folks are far superior
to those who like cats.

Cats sneak about
on their fur-covered paws;
to creep in the dark
and disregard Laws.

Cats are, as a rule,
quite ill-behaved.
They won't sit or speak
and rarely obey.

Cats aren't very social
and at times, downright rude.
They like to ignore you
to go sit and brood.

Cats like to leave fur-balls
all over the house:
they get in the toaster
and cling to your blouse.
