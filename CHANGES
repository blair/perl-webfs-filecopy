	Release version 1.02.

Thu Nov  2 10:44:11 PST 2000

	Require and use the latest versions of all the HTTP related
	Perl modules, since the error messages from the modules appear
	to have changed and this will make sure that the test scripts
	in the test directory pass.  This means using the following
	new modules:

	    Net::FTP 2.56
	    LWPng 0.24
	    LWP 5.48
	    URI 1.09

Thu Nov  2 10:25:34 PST 2000

	Change all of the email addresses in all of the documentation
	from blair@geostaff.com to blair@akamai.com.

	In WebFS::FileCopy::Put::File, when opening the output file
	call binmode() on the file handle so that binary files are
	properly written on Windows operating systems.

	When opening a FTP connection to put a file on the FTP server,
	no longer set default values for the username, password and
	account in WebFS::FileCopy::_open_ftp_connection and instead
	let the Net::FTP module set these since it has some code to
	handle FTP proxy's.  In particular, having
	WebFS::FileCopy::_open_ftp_connection set the account value to
	`home' if the account value was not previously set would cause
	failures on some FTP servers since Net::FTP would always
	attempt the ACCT command on the FTP server, which some servers
	do not recognize and the login would fail.

	Object destruction was not occurring of LWP::Request objects since
	the data_cb and done_cb hash elements are anonymous subroutines
	that contained references to external objects.	Now all the
	WebFS::FileCopy subroutines delete these hash elements and object
	destruction occurs normally.

	Add some debugging code to the modules.  If
	$WebFS::FileCopy::WARN_DESTROY is true, then upon destruction
	some modules will now print a message that they were destructed.

	Add a test to check the filename to directory appending code
	in copy_urls.

Fri Jul  2 22:00:01 PDT 1999

	Allow HTTP::Request and LWP::Request's to be passed to all
	WebFS::FileCopy subroutines.  This allows authentication to
	be included in a HTTP::Request to log into private portions of
	web sites.

	Do a lot of internal renaming of URL to URI.

	Update the module to use URI instead of URI::URL.  Check for
	URI 1.02 in Makefile.PL.

	Update to use LWPng-alpha 0.24 which now uses URI instead of
	URI::URL.

	Increase the number of tests in t/01copy.t to check the return
	from any WebFS::FileCopy command for a defined values.

	Check for Digest::MD5 version 2.06 instead of MD5 version 1.7
	in Makefile.PL.

	Release version 1.00.

Thu Apr  8 10:20:30 PDT 1999 <bzajac@akamai.com> (Blair Zajac)

	Have ok() in t/*.t return the success or failure of the test
	instead of the number of tests performed.

	Update Makefile.PL to require LWPng_alpha 0.23, LWP 5.34, and
	HTML::Parser 2.19.

	Rename all gen_response to give_response after LWPng changed the
	name of LWP::Request->gen_response to LWP::Request->give_response.

Sat Jul  4 09:59:33 PDT 1998 <blair@gps.caltech.edu> (Blair Zajac)

	Replace occurrences of EGADS with WebFS::FileCopy in Makefile.PL.
	Noted by Lupe Christoph <lupe@alanya.m.isar.de>.

	Rename the WebFS::UA package to WebFS::FileCopy::UA and
	WebFS::Response to WebFS::FileCopy::Response to keep the name
	space cleaner.

Thu Jul  2 10:45:31 PDT 1998 <blair@gps.caltech.edu> (Blair Zajac)

	Per Gisle's request, put _start_read_request and
	_start_transfer_request in a new WebFS::UA package and
	_read_content in a new WebFS::Response package.
